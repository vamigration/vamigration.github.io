## Details

Visual Analytics project for the [BDMA course by Petra Isenberg ](https://www.aviz.fr/TeachingVA2019/Schedule) at CentraleSupelec

January 2020

## Overview

70.8 million people are forcibly displaced worldwide for reasons such as poverty or war.
We collected nearly 351,000 migration-related tweets during the months of August, September and October from the United States and the United Kingdom.
Social media is a rich source of information to observe and understand the views of the general population towards migrants and refugees: how much the matter concerns them, how they feel about it and what events are perceived as particularly important.

## Source Data set
